# Terraria-Backup
A backup tool for Terraria written in C++

This is one of my first semi-polished projects in C++ so feel free to critisize it and tell me a better way to code it.
Your feedback is appreciated.

This was written using Qt and probably only works in Windows. This was a test to see if I could write a somewhat polished and error free program
complete with and installer and such. It is also a replacement for my old program written in Python.
